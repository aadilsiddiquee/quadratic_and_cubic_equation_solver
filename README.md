# Quadratic and Cubic Equation Solver

A C++ program that allows you to solve quadratic and cubic equations interactively. This program takes user input for coefficients and calculates real and complex roots based on the degree of the equation.

## Usage

1. Choose the degree of the equation (2 for quadratic, 3 for cubic).
2. Enter the coefficients as prompted.
3. The program will calculate and display the roots of the equation.

## Features

- Handles quadratic (degree 2) and cubic (degree 3) equations.
- Supports real and complex roots.
- Detects invalid inputs.

## How to Run

Compile and run the program using a C++ compiler:
```bash
g++ -o equation_solver equation_solver.cpp
./equation_solver
